# Challanges:
There were a few issues with image and style files in webpack. It was going to take some time to debug because I'm not experienced with webpack, so I decided to write style in style tags in html.

# Things I would like to do if I had more time:
- I thought about creating elements by referencing the selected images from the first step. I started writing the code, but it was getting late and I had to take them back.
- Idea was to push all the selected elements into an array. Then loop through the array and append them to the second page's section.
- I know that I could avoid some of the html elements by using sass, but I'd need to research the internet for the syntax.


# Take aways
1. I've realized that I should learn more about Sass and practise javascript syntax, as I had to google a few things.
2. Webpack was a bit hard to understand, but I read about Gulp while I was researching. So I might start learning those as well.
3. It's really fun to code!
